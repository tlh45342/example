# example

This appears to be an example of NCURSES.  Make sure to follow the installation to install Dialog.  This appears to test
using dialog via a BASH shell.  And Yes.  I completely forgot that I put this in here.  Nice.

## INSTALLATION

To alter NCURSES default characters to those which would better support lines. Not necessary for windows "terminal" console using ssh.
```bash
export NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS=1
```

```bash
apt install dialog
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tlh45342/example.git
```
